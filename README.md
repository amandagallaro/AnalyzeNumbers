# AnalyzeNumbers
-> Implement a function named 'initializeArray' which will store user's integer inputs into an array
 -> Implement a function named 'smallestValueOfArray' which is to find out the smallest value in an integer array provided as a parameter
 -> Implement a function named 'averageOfArray' which is to find out the average value in an integer array provided as a parameter
 -> Implement a function named 'lowerElementsOfArray' which is to find out the number of values in an integer array provided as a parameter, which is less than a value provided as a parameter
 -> Implement a function named 'upperElementsOfArray' which is to find out the number of values in an integer array provided as a parameter, which is above a value provided as a parameter
 -> Test the above functions in the main function:
    -> Read a list of 10 integer numbers from users
    -> Compute their smallest and average value
    -> Find out how many numbers are above the average and how many are below the average
